iPhone Folders is a Windows Explorer extension that allows you to browse contents of your iPhone or iPod Touch like a regular removable drive. After installation you'll find it in My Computer folder.

Using this extension you can browse your phone filesystem, copy files to and from it, open files directly from iPhone, create shortcuts to folders on iPhone. In thumbnail mode program will display previews of png and jpg files on phone, application icons for installed applications (.app folders).

Compatible with x86 editions of Windows XP, Vista, 7 and x64 editions of Windows XP, Vista (unlike Vista, Windows 7 x64 can't be forced to execute Windows Explorer in 32bit mode, so no Win7 x64 support for now). Requires iTunes 8 or 9 for normal operation. Supports jailbroken and non-jailbroken phones (in the later case filesystem access is limited to Media folder). To be able to browse full filesystem content on blackra1n jailbroken phones don't forget to install afc2add from Cydia
 
Enjoy!
